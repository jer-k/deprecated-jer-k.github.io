Intro

We have open sourced our own frontend *thing* called Gluestick, the repo can be found at https://github.com/truecar/gluestick. [Todd Williams](https://github.com/toddw), one of our lead Javascript developers did a great write up for an introduction to Gluestick on the TrueCar Tech Blog [Driven By Code](https://www.drivenbycode.com/). The article, Getting Started With Gluestick (updated for Gluestick v1) can be found [here](https://www.drivenbycode.com/getting-started-with-gluestick-updated/).

Having done plenty of work in Gluestick projects myself, I wanted to explore setting up a vanilla Rails application and a vanilla Gluestick application, build Dockerfiles for both and see if I could reliably do my development work using this setup. If you would like to see the finished project you can find the repository [Rails Gluestick Docker](https://github.com/jer-k/rails_gluestick_docker) on my Github. 

While I'm not unfamiliar with Docker, and as I mentioned in my post about [adding testing to a gem](https://jer-k.github.io/testing-and-developer-scripts-for-active-record-gem/) about how I really stumbled through setting up that Dockerfile, I've learned a lotthrough the process of setting up this project. Lets get started with the Gluestick application because isn't quite as much configuration needed.
