Now lets make easier for someone to wants to start using the gem by editing `bin/setup`.

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
IFS=$'\n\t'
set -vx

bundle install

psql postgres -tAc "SELECT 1 FROM pg_roles WHERE rolname='gem_with_database'" | grep -q 1 || \
psql postgres --command="create role gem_with_database with superuser login password 'password'"

psql postgres -tAc "SELECT 1 FROM pg_database WHERE datname='gem_with_database_development'" | grep -q 1 || \
rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```
Once the database is created and has data in it, we want to start playing around with out models and we can ensure everything is ready by modifying `bin/console`.

```
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'bundler/setup'
require 'gem_with_database'
require 'active_record'
require 'logger'
require 'pry'

ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(
  :adapter => 'postgresql',
  :database => 'gem_with_database_development'
)
ActiveRecord::Base.logger = Logger.new(STDOUT)

Pry.start
```

```
# Show a query
```

Rspec
