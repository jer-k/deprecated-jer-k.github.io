A new year, a new attempt at blogging! A few years ago I spun up... this blog! (_hint hint_ look at [Getting Started](getting-started)) with a hope to write more. I never set any goals when I started, I just wanted to begin my journey of writing. I've had times where I've written more and others (_cough_ this year) where I've written less, but one thing has remained hard and that is writing itself. When the only writing I'm doing is trying to explain a technical issue, a precursor to any writing is that I require a technical issue to explain and I feel like this is a hiderence. What I've wanted and feel like I need is an outlet to write a little more freely, but in a longer form than tweets and no, I don't really consider tweetstorms (are they even still called that?) a good medium for longer form.

Thus with my blog, I set out to creating a secondary feed called **Thinking Out Loud** to allow for my thoughts to flow a little more freely. I want to set a goal to at least 52 thinking posts in 2021. Ideally that will be one a week, but sometimes life will get in the way and I'll need to do double duty. I'm happy to have accomplished revamping my blog and getting this outlet set up before the end of the year. Hope you enjoy my future ramblings!
