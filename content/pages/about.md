I grew up in Oregon and attended Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science. I received my BS in 2012 and moved to San Francisco to work at a startup, CarWoo! After a year and a half at CarWoo!, [TrueCar](https://truecar.com) acquired us at the end of 2013. On January 1st, 2014 I started at TrueCar and I worked there until 2019; during which I relocated to Santa Monica, CA in 2017. I took a break from working at the end of 2019 and relocated to Portland, OR. After a vacation to Australia and New Zealand, I started working at [Release](https://releaseapp.io) in March of 2020.

My primary stack includes Javascript (React), Ruby (Rails), and PostgreSQL. I try to use Docker locally, but my laptop fan dislikes me when I do. 
On the side I like to read about Elixir (Phoenix), Functional Programming, Kubernetes, and DevOps topics.

Outside of programming I enjoy video games, going to the gym, practicing yoga, riding my bike, going on hikes, and trying to learn more about photography.

After not having a dog since college, I decided get another companion, his name is Cliff and you can find him on Instgram at [@cliffthedachshund](https://www.instagram.com/cliffthedachshund/).
