## Welcome to my thoughts. 

This section of my site is a raw format in which I'm trying to work on my writing. It will be much shorter form, probably a few hundred words per post, but hopefully more frequent. I have tons of ideas in my head for longer form blog posts, however I find that it takes me a long time to write and refine them. I know that Iâ€™m not going to create a perfect post in the first pass, but being able to get that first pass onto paper much quicker is something I would like to be able to do.

# Hope you enjoy these brief glimpses into my head.
