### About Me

I grew up in Oregon and attended Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science. I received my BS in 2012 and moved to San Francisco to work at a startup, CarWoo! TrueCar acquired CarWoo! at the end of 2013 and I've been working at TrueCar ever since.

I spend most of my time writing Rails and every now and then I'll do some work in React. In my spare time I'm learning Elixir and reading more about Functional Programming.
