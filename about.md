I grew up in Oregon and attended Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science. I received my BS in 2012 and moved to San Francisco to work at a startup, CarWoo! TrueCar acquired CarWoo! at the end of 2013 and I've been working at TrueCar ever since.

My primary stack includes React/Redux, Rails, and PostgreSQL. We use Docker locally and for deployments on AWS. 
On the side I like to read about Elixir, Phoenix, and Functional Programming.

Outside of programming I enjoy going to the gym, practicing yoga, riding my bike, going on hikes, and trying to learn more about photography.
