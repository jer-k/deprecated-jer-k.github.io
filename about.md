I grew up in Oregon and attended Oregon State University majoring in Computer Science. I received my BS in 2012 and moved to San Francisco to work at a startup, CarWoo! TrueCar acquired CarWoo! at the end of 2013 and I worked there until 2019. I recently took a break and started working at Release.

My primary stack includes Javascript (React), Ruby (Rails), and PostgreSQL. I try to use Docker locally, but my laptop fan dislikes me when I do. 
On the side I like to read about Elixir (Phoenix), Functional Programming, Kubernetes, and DevOps topics.

Outside of programming I enjoy going to the gym, practicing yoga, riding my bike, going on hikes, and trying to learn more about photography.
